# Workshop on Magnetism in Low-Mass Stars and Compact Remnants
**Dates:** 9 December (afternoon) â€“ 11 December (forenoon), 2025  
**Venue:** Indian Institute of Technology Bombay  

This workshop aims to bring together researchers interested in the **magnetohydrodynamic evolution of low-mass stars, white dwarfs, and compact binary systems**.

We will celebrate the **10-year anniversary of the first direct gravitational wave detection**, and explore connections to magnetic field evolution in binary remnants.

Key highlights:
- Pedagogical lectures by **Prof. Nils Andersson (University of Southampton, UK)**  
- Informal sessions combining astrophysical and computational perspectives  
- Thematic focus on dynamo theory, MHD turbulence, and magnetic evolution in stellar remnants
